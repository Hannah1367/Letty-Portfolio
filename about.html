<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Solace and Letty are a cool couple who both like to play with computers. Solace has been making programs for two years now. He's getting really good at it too! Solace's job is to help make apps and websites better.</p>
<p>Letty used to teach kids at school, but she likes building things on screens even more. She left teaching to learn how to code, just like Solace. Even though coding is hard, Letty is super smart and picks it up quickly.</p>
<p>When they have free time, Solace and Letty enjoy doing artistic stuff. Solace rocks out on his guitar and loves rock music. He dreams of being a famous musician one day. Letty sees colors in a special way and wants to learn how to paint with watercolors.</p>
<p>Both Solace and Letty work hard to get better at programming. If Solace gets a new, important job, he can take Letty to live with him in Europe. They think it will be fun to explore a new place and have a more relaxed life there❤️</p>
